In the era of pervasive cloud computing, securing sensitive data stored in the cloud 
has become paramount. Traditional encryption methods, while effective in protecting data at rest, 
often fall short in addressing the nuanced requirements of access control. This paper proposes a 
hybrid approach that integrates data owner-side and cloud-side access control mechanisms to 
enhance the security and flexibility of encrypted cloud storage systems. By combining fine-grained 
access control policies enforced by data owners with scalable, robust controls managed by cloud 
service providers, we aim to achieve a balanced and comprehensive security framework. Our 
approach leverages advanced cryptographic techniques, such as attribute-based encryption (ABE) 
and proxy re-encryption, to ensure that only authorized users can decrypt and access the data. Data 
owners define access policies using ABE, enabling them to maintain direct control over their data. 
Concurrently, cloud service providers implement complementary access control measures to enforce 
these policies and manage re-encryption keys securely. Our findings indicate that this dual-layered 
access control strategy not only bolsters data security but also provides a flexible, scalable solution 
suitable for a wide range of cloud storage applications.
